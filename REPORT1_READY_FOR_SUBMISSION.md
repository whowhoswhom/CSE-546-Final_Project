## 🚀 Next Steps: Converting to Word/PDF

### Option 1: Using Pandoc (Fastest - Recommended)
```bash
# Install pandoc if needed
# Windows: choco install pandoc
# Mac: brew install pandoc

# Convert markdown to Word
pandoc Report1-submission.md -o CSE546_Report1_Fuentes.docx
```

### Option 2: Online Converter
1. Go to https://www.markdowntoword.com/
2. Upload `Report1-submission.md`
3. Download as .docx

### Option 3: Manual (Most Control)
1. Open `Report1-submission.md` in any text editor
2. Copy content to Microsoft Word
3. Apply formatting (12pt font, proper headings)

### After Conversion:
1. **Insert all 9 figures** at marked locations (see `REPORT1_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md`)
2. **Format tables** with professional styling
3. **Check page count** (should be 7-10 pages)
4. **Verify font size** is 12pt throughout
5. **Save as**: `CSE546_Report1_Fuentes.docx`

**Detailed instructions**: See `REPORT1_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md`
